//How to run this program w/o breaking it

Program assumes that all input is integer and viable, though it does
accomodate values that have already been entered, or attempting to delete
non-present values. Essentially, provided the first entry in the data.txt file
is a prime, and all other inputs are integers, the program will run fine.

Data file must be formatted as follows, with only integer values:

[file start]
TABLE_SIZE (a prime number)
number entry
number entry
etc
etc
[file end]
